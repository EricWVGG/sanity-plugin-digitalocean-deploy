  <strong>Trigger DigitalOcean Deploy Hooks from your Sanity Studio.</strong><br />
‚ú® LIVE status updates ‚ú® multiple deployments ‚ú® active polling ‚ú®
</p>

## Install

Run the following command in your studio folder using the Sanity CLI:

```sh
sanity install digitalocean-deploy
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** If your Studio is not using the `@sanity/dashboard` part, you'll need to manually install this as well:

```sh
sanity install @sanity/dashboard
```

<br />

## Your first DigitalOcean Deployment

Once installed, you should see a new "Deploy" tool in your Sanity Studio navbar.

To create a new deployment, click the `Add Project` button. Next, you'll be prompted to add the following:

**`Title`**

> A name for your deployment. This can be whatever you want, to help you organize your deployments. Typically, this should be the environment you are deploying to, like `Production` or `Staging`

<br />

**`Deploy App ID`**

> This is the DigitalOcean App ID you want to trigger.

<br />

**`API Token`**

> This is a token from your DigitalOcean Account (not project). TODO: directions

üòé Once you've created your deployment you can now trigger deploys at anytime!
